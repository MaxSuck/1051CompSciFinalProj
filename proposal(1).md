# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

## String Art Generator

TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

## a program that converts a normal image, hopefully one the user decides into string art. It will also prompt how detailed the user would like it (ie amount of nails to connect sttring).
TODO

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

## the software will use turles and a preplanned points to draw an image. it will have to convert the image to greyscale and compare the final product to the image, pixel by pixel. I am unsure about everything needed to do to learn it, but a lot of math likely and knowledge of pyhton will be necessary.
TODO

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## Peter Gurdev, 
TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

## there will only be one outcome, and that is this working. Hopefully it only takes thanksgiving break. I am willing to put way too much effort into this. So a good outcome is this working with little work outsided of the break. If not I will be very upset. 

TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

## I think if all goes well I can hopefully implement a UI to make it so you can copy and past images and a scroller for detail. 

TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

## the best outcome would be a full UI and a color setting. Though instructions would then be impossible for someone to follow. A robot could be given the instructions and follow them well. A dye vat could be attached to some part of the string and mix values of Cyan, Magenta, And Yellow to get a full picture. Though the instructions would have to be much different from this to that as the srting would need to be dyed steps ahead of the current motion of the machine. This wowuld never happen, but I can only hope I had that much dedication.

TODO

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

## I am still unsure exactly what needs to be learned. I should have the basic knowledge of how to construct this. However I am unsure how I will put this together. I know I would like to look into gui, like the boxes I learned in Java. This is definetily my most ambitious project but it will be fun.
