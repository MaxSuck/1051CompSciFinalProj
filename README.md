String Art Final Project

String art generator. Takes an image, some are already stored in a dictionary. 
Install TKinter and Pillow, tkinter is automattacally in pyhton on macos.

Use first slider to select preset images
next select amount of points along the circle
then the amount of strings you would like (iterations) the more you do the darker the image it can look worse or better. Anything above 1500 is long wait.
length of string will vary the minimun length the strings will go to connect to another nail. the lower the more they may clump to a dark corner.
the size of the image will length of the strig needs to go. Will greatly affect speed. May look better. Higher the number the higher quality image you could get. Though the run time takes forever. So advise against it.

How does it work?
It finds the darkest line from point a to points x and then will conect the darkest line add that line to a list and not connect to those to points again.

very simple in hindsight, but took forever to figure out. Also does not produce quality outputs we where hoping for. But that could be a setting issue. Works well enough.
